I, I wish I could swim 
like dolphins, like dolphins can swim
though nothing will keep us together
we can beat them forever and ever
oh, we can be heroes
just for one day
oh, we can be heroes

            I, I can remember
            standing, standing by the wall
            and the guns, shot above our heads
            and we kiss as though nothing could fall
            and the shame, the shame is on the other side
            oh, we can beat them
            forever and ever
            and we can be heroes
